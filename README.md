## These projects are part of the deep neural networks class for "Dr.Saeed Reze Kherad Pishe" masterâ€™s program:


### Project 1: Investigated the impact of various network parameters (layer count, dropout, batch normalization) on performance using the EMNIST dataset.
Code available at 1/ex1.ipynb


### Project 2: Implemented a neural network to predict missing columns in FashionMNIST images and explored different methods for image completion.
Code available at 2/ex2.ipynb

### Project 3: Examined Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on traffic sign data, utilizing pre-trained models, and analyzed the effects of grayscale conversion on model accuracy.
Code available at 3/ex3.ipynb

### Project 4: Applied RNNs, including LSTM and GRU, to predict Tesla's stock price using different feature sets and compared predictions with actual values.
Code available at 4/ex4.ipynb


### Project 5: Used autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to colorize grayscale images, evaluated model performance, and compared generated colors with real images.
